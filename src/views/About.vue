            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I’m a developer and designer based in Manchester, UK, with nearly five years of experience at Manchester Metropolitan University. My work primarily involves developing resources focused on learning, teaching, and assessment. I hold a Master's degree from the University of Central Lancashire, which I earned in 2016. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work across various media. Previously, I dabbled in building video game worlds and creating books. Currently, my efforts are centered around video production, web development, and e-learning. I have a strong passion for topics such as art, film, curation, and creativity.</p>
